# Shell 301
## Lesson 6: exit & journalctl

`cd ~/Work/Guru/shell/301`

`gedit &`

`nautilus . &`
___

### *Note* `exit` *&* `journalctl` *are used for logs*

*Look at some log entries on your machine*

`journalctl`

*Use Space to scroll down, Ctrl+C to close*

*That is a log file on your machine*

*Errors are important, handle them correctlyin Shell scripts!*

> *An* `exit` *is a way to "break" out of a script, such as* `if - then` *tests, but always use* `exit 0` *unless a problem or event needs to be logged!*
> 
> *It is considered "bad coding" to use* `exit` *without a number or to use an exit other than* `exit 0` *without need for a log entry*
> 
> *When tutorials only have* `exit` *in the example, it is up to you to put the correct number after, probably* `exit 0`
> 

*Send* STDOUT *(output) to a file with:* `> OUTPUTFILE`

*Send* STDERR *(error output) to a file with:* `2> OUTPUTFILE`

`ls dumbo`

*Note the error message in the terminal*

`ls dumbo 2> error.log`

*Not the same error message went into the file*

`gedit error.log`

`ls dumbo 2> error.log`

*gedit: Reload error.log*

`ls dumbo 2>> error.log`

*gedit: Reload error.log*

*Combine this into one command with:* `> NORMALOUT 2> ERROROUT`

`ls bozo > normal.log 2>> error.log`

`ls > normal.log 2>> error.log`

*gedit: Reload error.log*

`gedit normal.log`

*Send* STDERR *(error output) into the nothingness with:* `> /dev/null 2>&1`

`ls dumbo > /dev/null 2>&1`

`ls`

*See! Nothing at all!*

*Note* `journalctl` *is for system logs, but you can create your own logs*

#### Creat log files for normal STDOUT and error STDERR in Shell

`gedit 06-logging-1`

*Note* `exec` *basically means "whatever the current command is", don't lose sleep over it, just see how it is used*

`./06-logging-1`

`ls`

*Note, the file errors.log was created*

`gedit errors.log`

`gedit 06-logging-2`

*Note* `> OUTFILE` *is the same as* `1> OUTFILE` *because* `>` *&* `1>` *are for* STDOUT (`exit 1`) *while* `2>` *is always for* STDERR (`exit 2`)

`./06-logging-2`

*gedit Reload: errors.log*

`gedit normal.log`

`gedit 06-logging-3`

`./06-logging-3`

*Note, the file all.log was created*

`gedit all.log`

*Both* STDOUT *and* STDERR *went to the same file because this makes errors behave like normal output:* `2>&1`

`gedit 06-logging-4`

`./06-logging-4`

`ls`

*Note the file exit-3.log was created*

`gedit exit-3.log`

*Note setting exit messages only works 3-9*

`gedit 06-logging-5`

`./06-logging-5`

`ls`

*Note the file exit-2.log was created*

`gedit exit-2.log`

*Note setting exit 2 messages will appear before STDERR error messages in a 2> error log*

*Note you can set exit 0 also, but that's strange*

`gedit 06-logging-6`

`./06-logging-6`

`ls`

*Note the file exit-0.log was created*

`gedit exit-0.log`

*Moral of the story: always use* `exit` *with a number!*
- `exit 0` everything is normal, no output  ( with `echo "something"` `>&0` ...if you are strange )
- `exit 1` everything is normal, with STDOUT
- `exit 2` something is wrong, with STDERR error messages
- `exit 3-9` you are cool and make your own exit messages ( with `echo "something"` `>&3`-`>&9` )
- `exit` you are lazy and something is wrong with YOU!

*FYI, you can create a read-only system log file for your script*

`gedit 06-logging-7`

*Learn more for read-only system logs* [https://ops.tips/gists/redirect-all-outputs-of-a-bash-script-to-a-file/]
