# Shell 201
## Lesson 0: sudo passwd

##### Create `su` (Super User) password

The Shell 201 course occasionally requires `sudo` or `su` permissions.

If you are not a "sudoer", you need the machine (computer) administrator (mom, dad, owner, teacher?) nearby to input the password for some `su` jobs in the lessons.

___

*This sets a password for* `su` *if it has not been done already...*

*You MUST be a "sudoer" for this..."

`sudo su` *Input your password, then input the new password for the* `su` *user*

*That's it, all done.*
